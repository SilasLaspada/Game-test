# Game test
This is a basic "game" that I am making to learn C. There really isn't anything to it yet, but I plan to add stuff like a basic combat system later.
This game will never really be good because it's main focus is to be functional as opposed to being fun. Do let me know if you have any suggestions though, I am trying to learn!
Compile using Code::Blocks.
